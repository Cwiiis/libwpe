=======================
1.0.0 - August 21, 2018
=======================

This release changes the API version to 0.2, and introduces the following
changes and features:

- The library is now called libwpe to avoid confusion. The WPEBackend name
  used previously seemed to indicate that the library implemented a WPE
  backend. The new libwpe name better reflects that it contains code needed
  by the WPE WebKit port.
- The libwpe library now uses the libtool versioning convention.
- Handle conversion of keysyms to Unicode inside libwpe. This allowed to
  remove he "unicode" member from keyboard event structs, and removing
  wpe_input_key_mapper/wpe_input_key_mapper_interface.
- New field in event structs to specify keyboard modifiers.
- New API for keymap and composition handling based on libxkbcommon.


====================
0.2.0 - July 9, 2018
====================

This is a backwards-compatible release, which adds the following features:

- New API to set and query the backend implementation library being used.
- New API to query the version library, both with macros at build time,
  and functions at runtime.
- Trying to use a backend implementation library which does not provide
  a "load_object" callback will produce a meaningful error instead of
  silently failing.
