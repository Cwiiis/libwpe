====================
0.2.0 - July 9, 2018
====================

This is a backwards-compatible release, which adds the following features:

- New API to set and query the backend implementation library being used.
- New API to query the version library, both with macros at build time,
  and functions at runtime.
- Trying to use a backend implementation library which does not provide
  a "load_object" callback will produce a meaningful error instead of
  silently failing.
